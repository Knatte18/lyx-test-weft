<!-- This is the RoleOrchestrator friction directive: the variant internal/friction.Directive renders
     for webster's Master session, which forks implementers rather than editing code itself.
     Its consuming call site is one of the four internal/websterengine/render.go composers.
     internal/friction.Directive reads this file through stencilstore.Read, strips this banner with
     stencil.StripLeadingComment, and substitutes the literal "{{.note_path}}" token below with the
     composed absolute note path before returning the result.
     The stripped, substituted result is injected as a producer template's optional
     friction_directive marker value, so it is never itself passed through stencil.Fill.
     This file declares no marker of its own beyond "{{.note_path}}" and must stay otherwise
     marker-free, because stencilstore.Validate parses it regardless of whether anything ever fills
     it.

## Friction note — optional, only if something went wrong

Writing this note is **optional**. An absent note is the normal outcome and never an error — most
sessions produce nothing here and that is correct.

Write a note **only when something actually went wrong** while you were forking or coordinating
implementer strands: a batch that stalled for a reason worth remembering, a recovery you had to
reach for more than once, a plan step that turned out to be underspecified once forks started
running against it, anything that cost you real time or nearly derailed the run.

If you decide to write one, put a title line naming what you were forking or coordinating, followed
by one or two short paragraphs of freeform markdown describing the friction. There is no schema to
follow. Write it to exactly this path, with no filename of your own choosing:

{{.note_path}}
