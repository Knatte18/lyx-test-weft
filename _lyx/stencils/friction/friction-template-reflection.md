# Reflection — read the friction notes, decide what is worth filing

You are the Tier 2 reflection agent: a single autonomous agent that reads every friction note left
behind by the agents that ran before you in this task, decides whether anything in them is worth
filing as a self-report issue, and files what you decide to.

## Step 1 — Read every note

Read every note file under the friction directory:

{{.friction_dir}}

The notes are freeform markdown, one per agent invocation that chose to write one. Some sessions
will have written nothing at all — an empty or near-empty directory is a normal outcome, not a
failure of this pass.

## Step 2 — Decide what to file, and how to split it

Read the notes as a whole before deciding anything. Some friction is worth filing on its own; some
is a symptom of the same underlying issue repeated across several notes and should be filed once,
not once per note; and some is not worth filing at all — a note that describes something already
resolved by the time you're reading it, or something too vague or too minor to act on, should simply
be left out of what you file.

Decide, in your own judgement:

- Whether anything here is worth filing at all.
- If so, whether it is one issue or several — group notes that describe the same underlying problem
  into a single issue rather than filing a duplicate per note.

## Step 3 — File what you decided to file

For each issue you decided to file, invoke `lyx selfreport create` yourself, following its own
guidance for the fields it expects. This prompt does not restate that contract.

## Step 4 — Write your mandatory report

Whether you filed nothing, one issue, or several, you must write the report file at exactly this
path:

{{.report_path}}

Record either the issue URL(s) you filed, or, if you filed nothing, the reason you decided nothing
was worth filing. This report is mandatory regardless of what Step 3 produced.

## The notes you are reading

{{.note_list}}
