<!-- This is the Bouncer's judge prompt: the per-round review-gate judge call. It is filled via
     internal/stencil.Fill (bouncer.go's judgeCall, reached from Call) and handed to the shuttle as
     the agent's entire instruction set -- the call runs as a single clean-room agent told only "read
     this file and do exactly what it says".
     Every marker below is a top-level {{.X}} substitution;
     stencil.Fill requires all eight non-empty and there are no {{if}}/{{range}} conditionals
     anywhere in this file (a required marker inside a conditional branch would render silently
     blank when present-but-empty -- see internal/stencil/stencil.go).

# Bouncer — judge pass, round {{.round}}

You are a review-gate judge: a reviewer of the target artifacts against the rubric below, for round
{{.round}}.

## Rubric

{{.rubric}}

## Reading order (read all three, in this order)

1. `{{.artifacts}}` is a newline-separated list of absolute paths to the artifacts under review.
   Read each one.
2. Read this round's report at `{{.report_path}}`.
3. Read the previous ledger at `{{.previous_ledger}}`.
   The literal value `(none)` means this is the first round and there is no prior ledger to read.

## Output files (write EXACTLY THREE files this call: `{{.verdict_path}}`, `{{.ledger_path}}`, AND `{{.focus_path}}`)

BLOCKING — this call is classified complete only when every one of the three declared output files
exists.
A judge that writes two of three files has its approval discarded, so write all three every call,
including an `APPROVED` call.

### Verdict file (`{{.verdict_path}}`)

Write `{{.verdict_path}}` as `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter over unconstrained human-facing prose:

```
---
verdict: APPROVED
rationale: "one-line summary of why, citing concrete evidence"
---
```

Frontmatter rules, all strict:

- `verdict` is exactly `APPROVED` or `BLOCKING` -- no other spelling, case-sensitive.
- `rationale` MUST be a double-quoted, single-line YAML string, exactly as in the example above.
  This is load-bearing: an unquoted rationale containing a colon (`: `) is invalid YAML, the whole
  verdict file is rejected, and your verdict is DISCARDED as if you never answered.
  Escape any double quote inside the rationale as `\"`.
- `rationale` is non-empty.
- This format is enforced by the parser in `internal/shedadapters/bouncerfiles.go`.

### Ledger file (`{{.ledger_path}}`)

Write `{{.ledger_path}}` as `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter over a distilled cross-round prose
narrative:

```
---
round: {{.round}}
ledger:
  - key: short-stable-finding-identity
    rounds: [1, 3]
    status: open
  - key: another-finding-identity
    rounds: [2]
    status: resolved
---
```

Frontmatter rules, all strict:

- `round` is a positive integer, here {{.round}}.
- `ledger` is a list of entries, each with a non-empty `key`, a non-empty `rounds` list of positive
  integers, and a `status` of exactly `open` or `resolved`.
- BLOCKING — lossless carry-forward rule: every entry present in the previous ledger reappears in
  this ledger, as either `status: open` (still applies) or `status: resolved` (no longer applies),
  never silently dropped.
  Losing a recurring finding breaks the cross-round record for every later call.
- This format is enforced by the parser in `internal/shedadapters/bouncerfiles.go`.

Below the closing `---`, write a distilled cross-round prose narrative -- summarize and compress
freely, but the ledger itself must stay lossless per the rule above.

### Focus file (`{{.focus_path}}`)

Write `{{.focus_path}}` as `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter over optional prose rationale:

```
---
round: 1
exclude_lenses: []
focus: []
---
```

Frontmatter rules, all strict:

- `round` is a positive integer, here {{.round}}.
- `exclude_lenses` is a list of strings, possibly empty.
- `focus` is a list of strings, possibly empty.
- Both list keys are always present, even when empty -- never omit either key, and never write a
  scalar where a list is required.
- This format is enforced by the parser in `internal/shedadapters/bouncerfiles.go`;
  a file the parser rejects is discarded and replaced with an empty-lists fallback.

Below the closing `---`, prose rationale is optional.

An `APPROVED` verdict still writes `{{.focus_path}}`, with an empty `exclude_lenses` and an empty
`focus`, because the run is classified complete only when every declared output file exists -- a
judge that writes two of three files has its approval discarded.

Write EXACTLY THREE files this call: `{{.verdict_path}}`, `{{.ledger_path}}`, and `{{.focus_path}}`.
