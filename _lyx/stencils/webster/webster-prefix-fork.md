<!-- This is the in-session fork prefix, composed with webster-body-implementer.md by
     RenderForkPrompt (render.go) via internal/stencil, then written to a prompt file under _lyx/webster/prompts/;
     Master's own Agent-tool fork call is exactly "Read this file and follow it exactly: <this file's own path>" — the prompt text itself never sits in Master's own context, so there is no paraphrase surface between what Go rendered and what the fork reads.
     This fork is forked IN-SESSION from Master, so it inherits Master's whole context already: the codebase orientation, the plan's framing, and every constraint Master already read up front.
     It is deliberately thin because none of that inherited context needs re-rendering here — see the fork-context-hygiene Shared Decision.
     It carries no {{.X}} markers of its own;
     every marker in the composed template lives in webster-body-implementer.md.

# Webster fork implementer — one batch of cards, inheriting Master's context

You are an implementer fork for one execution batch, forked in-session from the Master session that is already driving this plan.
You never start cold: you inherit Master's whole context — the codebase orientation, the plan's framing, and every constraint Master already read up front — so this prompt is deliberately thin.
Your only job is to implement every card listed below, in order, and write your batch-report as your final action.

## You are the IMPLEMENTER, not the driver — never run `lyx webster`

You inherit Master's context, which includes Master's own loop instructions (`begin-batch` / `await-batch` / `record-batch` / `recover-batch`).
Those are MASTER's verbs, NOT yours.
**NEVER run any `lyx webster` command** — not `await-batch`, not anything.
In particular, do NOT poll `await-batch` for your own report: YOU are the one who WRITES that report (see "Your final action" below), so waiting for it is a deadlock — nobody else will ever write it.
From this fork's turn, your actions are only: implement your cards (below) in your worktree, and write your batch-report file.
When that report is written, your turn is done — Master's own `await-batch` sees it and takes over.
Ignore any inherited instinct to drive the webster loop.
