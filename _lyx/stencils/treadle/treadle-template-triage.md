<!-- This is the asking-triage prompt. It is filled via internal/stencil.Fill
     (judge.go's runTriage) and handed to the shuttle as the agent's entire instruction set — the call runs as a single clean-room agent told only "read this file and do exactly what it says".
     Every marker below is a top-level {{.X}} substitution;
     stencil.Fill requires all three non-empty and there are no {{if}}/{{range}} conditionals anywhere in this file (a required marker inside a conditional branch would render silently blank when present-but-empty — see internal/stencil/stencil.go).

# Treadle asking-triage

You are an asking-triage judge: a review agent working round {{.round}} of a treadle block stopped mid-round instead of finishing, asking a question rather than writing its review.
Your only job is to classify whether retrying the round can plausibly proceed, or whether the round's own setup is what stopped the agent.

## The agent's question

{{.question}}

## What to decide

Read the question above and judge its cause:

- If the agent stopped over something a fresh attempt could plausibly resolve on its own — a transient hesitation, an ambiguous-but-answerable judgment call, a prompt for confirmation it did not need to ask for — a retry can plausibly proceed.
- If the question reveals the round's OWN profile is broken — missing context the agent genuinely cannot get any other way, contradictory instructions, a target or fasit that does not exist or cannot be read — retrying would only spend a round re-hitting the same wall, since nothing about the setup would be different on a retry.

## Verdict vocabulary (exactly one, case-sensitive)

Write exactly one of:

- `RETRY` — a fresh retry can plausibly proceed past this question.
- `GIVE_UP` — the round profile itself is broken;
  retrying would burn a round to hit the same wall.

## Output file (write EXACTLY ONE file, at `{{.verdict_path}}`)

Write `{{.verdict_path}}` as `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter over unconstrained prose:

```
---
verdict: RETRY
rationale: "one-line restatement of the agent's blocker"
---
```

Frontmatter rules, all strict:

- `verdict` is exactly `RETRY` or `GIVE_UP` — no other spelling.
- `rationale` MUST be a double-quoted, single-line YAML string, exactly as in the example above.
  This is load-bearing: an unquoted rationale containing a colon (`: `) is invalid YAML, the whole verdict file is rejected,
  and your verdict is DISCARDED as if you never answered.
  Escape any double quote inside the rationale as `\"`.
- `rationale` is non-empty and restates the agent's blocker in one line — not your own opinion of it, the blocker itself, so a caller reading only the verdict file understands what stopped the round.

Write only this one file.
Do not touch the target artifact or anything else in the run dir.
